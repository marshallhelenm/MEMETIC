# GUESSY

Building a version of the game "Guess Who" to be played online, inspired by [this tiktok](https://ve.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_q8otm9qrlU1w0qmsw.mp4).

## TO DO list

### MVP

- Implement coordinated room contents (sockets?)
- Select player's card - highlight or show at top of page
- Fix awkward scroll
- Make it look good :(

### Nice to have/aesthetics

- toggle to make gifs static
- temp loading version of cards
- dynamically organize cards based on height to fit columns best?

### Future Features

- Live chat between players
