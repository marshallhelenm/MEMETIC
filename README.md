# GUESSY

Building a version of the game "Guess Who" to be played online, inspired by [this tiktok](https://ve.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_q8otm9qrlU1w0qmsw.mp4).

## TO DO list

### MVP

- Fix awkward scroll
- Make it look good
- periodically clear out local storage?

### Nice to have/aesthetics

- Select player's card - highlight or show at top of page
        - prompt user to pick this on joining the room?
- Prompt player for name when joining a new room
- Display own & fellow player's name

### Future Features

- Live chat between players
- Make Guess

### Pipe Dreams

- dynamically organize cards based on height to fit columns best?

### Dumb Ideas

- Every time you click on the spinning question mark it gets faster
        - if it gets fast enough it explodes?
